           <p ><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p>This course is designed to ignite and nurture creative thinking. Through various projects in digital composition, we explore uncharted territory, think outside the box, and approach problems with innovative solutions. Creative habits of mind are not just about artistic expression but also about finding novel ways to communicate and engage audiences effectively. For example, my abilities as a coder are not the best, but in my work for “Linear web text design”, I created a multi-page treasure hunt story plot. I thought of making a story with the side of having a user interaction. 
  </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p>Collaboration is a cornerstone of this course. We will actively participate in a workshop environment where we share our work, provide feedback to each other, and engage in constructive discussions. This collaborative spirit enhances our learning experience, allowing us to benefit from diverse perspectives and refine our projects through collective insights. In every workshop, I love looking at my peers' work and asking them how they did it. We have some brilliant coders and artists in our class, unfortunately, I am not one of them, and it is such an experience listening and learning about their work.
  </p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p>Crafting digital compositions involves more than just technical skills. It's about thoughtful and deliberate choices in design, content, and presentation. We students delve into the intricacies of digital craft, analyzing existing compositions to understand the nuances of effective storytelling and communication in the digital realm. For example, the storytelling in my  “Linear web text design” in my opinion is a good example of good storytelling, it has the engagement of characters, plot, conflict, resolution, and a theme/ message. I had more ideas when it comes to this project as in a flying dragon attacking and more conflict competencies but my lack of coding experience really held me back.

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p>To excel in digital composition, we embark on a journey of continuous research and skill development. we explore our chosen themes deeply, gathering relevant information and insights. Simultaneously, we hone our technical skills, mastering various digital tools and platforms necessary for creating impactful digital media. For example, to learn some of the HTML code I had to watch a few videos on Google searching for how to implement basic things.

            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p>Effective presentation is the key to making a digital composition resonate with its audience. In this course, we will not only create compelling content but also learn how to present it proficiently. This includes multimedia presentations and user interface design, ensuring that their work is not only impactful but also accessible and engaging for a broader audience in the digital landscape. I am not the best presenter and speaker, and I hope by the end of the course I have learned these basic skills.

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2&3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>By engaging in diverse projects within digital composition, we venture into new eras, break away from conventional approaches, and tackle challenges with inventive solutions. Cultivating a creative mindset extends beyond artistic expression; it's about discovering fresh methods to communicate and captivate audiences with impact. For example, I am not the most artistic and creative and that can be seen throughout the projects “Special Effects in Premiere Pro” and “Adobe After Effect Animation”. However, I tried my best and learned both of the programs. I plan on using these for my final project as well to catch the user's eyes. </p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>Collaboration plays a pivotal role in this course. We'll be actively involved in a workshop setting, exchanging our work, offering constructive feedback, and participating in meaningful discussions to enhance our collective learning experience. Every workshop has not only made my projects better but me more creative. As we know, I am not the most creative, however, the insights of working with my peers, it has helped me be more. More creative and more willing to engage and learn.   </p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>Creating digital compositions encompasses more than technical expertise. It revolves around intentional decisions in design, content, and presentation. As students, we explore the complexities of digital craftsmanship, examining current compositions to grasp the subtleties of compelling storytelling and effective communication in the digital domain. For example, nearly all my projects and makings in this Phase of the portfolio have to do with “Oral Health”. Oral Health is a topic I want to focus on not only right now in this class, but also in the future of the class for my final project, and not only in the final project it is also something I am very passionate about, and want to get into the oral health care field. 
  </p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p>To thrive in digital composition, we engage in an ongoing process of research and skill enhancement. Delving deeply into our selected themes, we collect pertinent information and insights. Concurrently, we refine our technical proficiency, mastering diverse digital tools and platforms essential for crafting influential digital media. Not only have I learned a lot about “Oral health”, but I have learned to use some what of Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Animator, and used features like Special Effects. 
  </p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>Successful delivery is crucial for a digital composition to connect with its audience. Throughout this course, we won't just develop captivating content but also acquire skills in proficient presentation. This encompasses multimedia presentations and user interface design, guaranteeing that our creations are not only influential but also accessible and engaging for a wider audience in the digital realm. After doing the multi-media presentation and presenting weekly to the group about my research, I have become slightly more comfortable presenting. I am not where I want to be and am super far from it. I hope to get there through this class!  </p>

  <h3>Phase 4 Course Goals</h3> <br>
  <h4><em>1.	Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p>If there is one thing I have learned in this class is that the sky is the limit when it comes to imaging and making what you want to make. For example, not only did I make a presentation on something I am passionate about but also with all the creative elements I implemented into the presentation itself, I did well trying to be as creative and fun as possible.   </p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p>As for someone whose coding and artistic ability are not highly regarded, I was able to do well in this class. I think the reason for that has to be the artistic and creative minds of my classmates. Engaging with others elevated my final project with custom CSS and unique code and made me feel more confident.  </p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p>My final project came out to over 24 HTML pages. I think I did a good job outlining every part of the project, something that helped me was the figma and drawing step-by-step steps from page to page. This allowed me to dig deeper and think more about my craft.   </p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>4. 4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development</em></h4>
  <p>Adding a button even when in the project we did at the beginning of the semester has always been difficult for me. However, with research and help from the professor (and some classmates), I was able to find and implement a unique and cool button that goes well with my final project and was very fitting.    </p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p>One thing I can proudly walk away with in this class is the ability to be comfortable with presenting whatever I have made no matter how bad I think it may be because someone will always find it cool or interesting. For example, I think my final presentation is very basic and nothing crazy and even though that may be the case, I have numerous people compliment it and it made me feel confident I got a sense of pride which is bad but in some cases can be very useful. I hope this carries over to my profession and other classes as well. </p>
